# Wordle clone + solver + backtesting

I created something. 

Or rather, I found about this game last week and decided that one challenge a day wasn't going to cut it, and decided to make my own clone. After all, the rules seemed easy enough to implement. After this, I figured I could make a solver using principles that I had learned in school, and had last touched in those very same courses. 

Here's how I did it.
